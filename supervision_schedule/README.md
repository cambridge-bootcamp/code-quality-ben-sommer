# Supervision Schedule

The file `supervision_schedule.py` contains well-formatted but un-typed code to find possible supervision times from entered schedules.

Despite the length of the code, there are very few places that type annotations are necessary; `mypy` can infer the types of most variables.

Add the minimum type hints necessary for mypy to be able to typecheck the whole program.
You might want to define a type `Schedule` to avoid repeating yourself!
