# Linting and type hints

This repo contains some example Python files with various formatting issues or incomplete type hints.
Each folder contains a `README.md` with an explanation of the task.

Start with the `wordle` example, then take a look at the `calculator` task. 
The `supervision_schedule` task has more complex types, if you finish and want a challenge.

GitHub Codespaces for Python usually come with the tools you'll need pre-installed.
You can use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the tools for this exercise, and to check they are already installed.
